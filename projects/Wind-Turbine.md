## Wind Turbine

Prior to entering the ICS department, I was originally in the College of Engineering majoring in Mechanical Engineering. In one of the courses I took, ME 213, We learned how to use the software: Solidworks. For our final project my team and I were tasked to designing and building a wind turbine. We split into subteams and I was in charge of designing the frame so that it could withhold a certain amoount of wind force. In our subteams we each designed our assigned component of the wind turbine and tested it within the solidworks software. After design phase we had to either craft the product according to the design or buy the correct parts to build it. We didn't want to build the traditional design so we came up with something unique, and in the end, our final product passed the voltage test when faced with "test wind" delivered by a leaf blower.
