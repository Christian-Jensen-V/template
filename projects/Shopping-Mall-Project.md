summary: Summer job that I gained valuable experience from. 
---

I took the opportunity to work on a job site over the summer. In this project, we were refurbishing the shopping center as it hasn't been maintained for more than a decade. This job taught me a valuable skill and made me realize not to take a laborers/ tradesman job for granted. The day was grueling as your body is in constant motion, lifting, hammering and measuring. Teamwork was a big part of this job as we usually had to team lift lumber across the parking lot and onto the roof. I made sure everyone was on track getting fetching tools and taking measurements so my co-workers could cross-reference their measurement with mine.

It was also very dangerous work and that why the safety precautions were in place. Hardhats, construction shirts, jeans, and shoes were just the basics. We wore masks when cutting Hardie board as it shot out cement dust which harmful to your lungs. Being able to experience the dangers of a job like this inspired me to think of ways technology could help make the workplace/ jobsite safer.
