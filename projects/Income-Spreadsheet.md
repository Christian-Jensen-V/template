## Tip Tracker

When I started working for Outback Steakhouse, I started to make some good money in the form of tips, and I wanted a way to track how much I make every month. I designed a spreadsheet where I could enter the hours I worked and the tips I made and calculate exactly how much I'd make in wages, net tips (after automatic tip outs), and how efficiently I'd been working in terms of $/hr. I started in July and would slowly edit the layout of the spreadsheet to a place where I was satisfied. The final design was finished in mid August (about a month of work-in-progress).
