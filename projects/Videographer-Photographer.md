I was brought into a filming program in my 7th grade of middle school which my Dad started with the school's principal to get students involved in football. My skills grew as I filmed football every weekend and I eventually went with my Dad to film gigs and reports for the news. This experience I had while I filmed was fun for me because on top of learning the tricks behind the camera, I got access to cool areas due to my skills and knowledge.

I was responsible for the main shots for most of the gigs I went to, from being on a concert stage to panning up models as they walk down the runway to highlight the designer's clothes. Theres been times where I only one shot to get footage of something and thats live action, no time to react you just got to go with your gut, which I learned to be a valuable tool. But when filming or taking shots a lot of pressure was put on me, but to be honest it was fun because of the rush.
