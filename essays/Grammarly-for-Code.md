## Why it is Important

The reason why coding standards are important is that it gives a universal standard to follow to make code easier to read and to make it less messy. If you think of it just like the MLA or APA format for writing it coding standards are something everyone can follow to practice good habits and to have readable code. Being neat with how you format your code could make the difference in getting a job versus someone beating you to it. When you remember how code is formated it almost reinforces the memorization of code blocks that everyone should know; the simple stuff. Coding standards are good going into the future as it will always improve and show new formats to make code look even neater. 

## My first impressions of ESlint

As much as it is a pain in the butt sometimes, I think that ESlint is healthy for me to use as it can point out critical and mundane mistakes with detail. This helps me understand my code more dynamically so I don't end up making the same mistake too many times. The only caveat I have with ESLint is how the red squiggles kinda interrupt the visual space. I'd like an option to turn it off while typing then it will activate afterward. But other than that the green checkmark may seem stupid to some, but this ensures students reach a satisfactory level of code formatting. The more mistakes you make the less you are gonna make because of how annoying it is, but that's good. 

## IntelliJ

IntelliJ is awesome, it has so many options to fiddle with and that is the reason why we use it for this class. Students need that type of practice because it is not all about programming its also about the program you use to do the programming. The best feature I think that IntelliJ is the code formatting options like I mentioned before, these help students a whole bunch, more than they know. Before other, then a python script to check code, in C and C++ there isn't a code checker per se when using VI or VIM. So that I believe is very helpful.
