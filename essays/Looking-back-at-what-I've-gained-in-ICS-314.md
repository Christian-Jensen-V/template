## First of what the heck is Software Development, and why we need it?

Usually when the average Joe with no understanding of coding or technical computer experience thinks about software development probably imagines a person with a hoodie mashing their keyboard in a dark room, typing all kinds of commands in a shell window with 10 monitors filled with Matrix-type symbols in front of them; oh and also hundreds of energy drinks scattered around(which isn't too far reality). But the truth is that it is literally what it sounds like, developing software, how to build website applications, think about how your code should communicate with each other, how to solve problems and manage projects, and so much more! Using the basic tools given to us to build works of art and applications that we can be proud of. Software that either improves, supports, or entertain us in our daily lives, is what its all about! Without software development we would not be as advanced with many types of equipment that rely on software to operate, some even are responsible for keeping people alive. Software avoids human failure, optimizes and  reduces mundane tasks that today we take for granted and overlook. Just take a look around, almost everyone in todays world cannot walk one inch without having something near, around, or above them that uses software.

## It's not just about web app development!

I as many was thought to believe that ICS 314 was just all about making websites and learning javascript alongside HTML. But that isn't really the case, yeah we learn the ins and outs of these new coding languages but we also gain an indepth understanding of how they both can live in harmony and how they can communicate with each other. Not only that we learn how we could use these skills to apply other resources to further develop our ideas and help us solve problems.
