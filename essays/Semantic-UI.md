## UI "Shortcuts"

Semantic UI is one example of a user interface (UI) framework that helps a programmer from beginner to advanced build websites faster, cleaner and more efficiently. There are many other frameworks such as Bootstrap, ReactUI etc. As of this semester, I had never used HTML or css before. When we started learning, it seemed intuitive, yet also tedious. When I used to look at websites, I used to wonder how they formatted everything and just figured there was some sort template. When designing website using "raw" HTML and CSS, the programmer must think of EVERYTHING. Take a simple image for example you have to think of size, shape, location, orientation, whether you want it in the background or foreground, if you're going to put any text over it, if it has to 'click-able', border, color of the border, etc. etc...
Now on one hand, this is kind of nice because in a sense it is completely customizable, however most times you just want a standard image in a simple commonly used format. This is where UI frameworks come in handy. You can simply say make me "circular centered borderless image" ... and you're done... This simplicity is wonderful. Then you look a bit closer and find there are a ton these "keywords" like "borderless", "centered", and "right/left" etc. Some say this is essentially learning a whole new language which, to me, is agreeable.

## Worth It?

So now we're faced with the question of: if this UI framework is such a hassle to learn and master, is it really worth learning. The way I see it is you have three tiers of websites: basic intermediate and advanced. This is not necessarily defined by the difficulty it takes to code but more the level of customization you require. Now in my opinion. If you're building a basic website, There are plenty of services that allow you to essentially "fill in the blanks" on a preset template of your choice - no coding necessary. You get into the intermediate level of websites, I think not only is this tier the most common, but where UI frameworks would thrive the most. While UI frameworks do allow full customization, they thrive when your design is closest to the frameworks' default design. In this sense, it's absolutely worth it (this of course is assuming you're going to be building websites semi-regularly). Once you master working with a framework, building your websites will become much more efficient and clean. Keep in mind this is coming from a student who's had just two weeks experience with one UI framework. As soon as you require an extreme level of customization (rare), I think it might be easier to just skip the frameworks, and customize it yourself using raw HTML and CSS.

## Conclusion

If you plan on making a living designing websites, learn a framework you like or maybe multiple frameworks. They might be tough or take a while to learn but it will definitely be benificial to you in the long run. And let's be honest anything worth learning is gonna take some effort to learn.
