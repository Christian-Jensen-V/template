## Javascript vs. the world

One of the very first things any beginner programmer learns about coding is the different types of variables that can be utilized such as integers, floats, characters, strings etc. Similarly when learning a new language for beginners, one of the first lines of code is writing a print statement of "Hello World!". C was the first language I ever properly learned and learning the data types and the syntax of a simple 'printf' statement was one of the biggest obstacles for me because really you're learning from the very beginning. Especially in C/C++ and Java learning the different variable types is very important because it is the barebones of learning how to create objects or abstract data types (ADT). Then I come to learn JavaScript and find out that you throw all that out the window and just call your variables "variables" then assign them to what you want. When I learned this I couldn't help think of how easy my life would be, especially when combined with the unique property of not having to define a return type. On one hand, I feel that this might only make sense if you can actually understand what is happening when you take advantage of these "shortcuts". For example: only because i learned Java and C do I fully understand the difference between these two variable assignments:

```
let x = 10;
let x = "10";
```
But on the other hand I can't help but feel as though I was put on "easy mode" in the game of programming. I realize that this is just one difference between Javascript and other languages, but my contention remains. If programming were my physical human body, in C I feel like I can control every fiber of every muscle, every vein, and every bone, where as in Javascript I can just tell myself to move forward. Already you can see why some would argue the superiority of one over the other. In short, I feel less in control, but I can't wait to see the possibilities.

## Ready, Set, Code!

In my first coding class taught in basic C, I was terrified of the final exam because I knew we were going to have to write a program in a set amount of time. But now as I have taken different, more advanced classes, I feel my brain is wired to think in code. When I took the practice WOD for the first time, I was excited. Excited to see just how quickly I can think of the solution and put it into working, compiling code. When I completed the task in the highest time range I was thrilled, knowing that I could visualize the problem and solution so quickly and efficiently. I also like how it forces you to think on your feet. This kind of thinking is very helpful when working on bigger projects and even outside of programming. To be able to analyze the problem and deduce exactly what needs to be done in order to solve the problem is crucial in programming, but even more in life. 

## Conclusion

Learning the syntax is never the most exciting part of learning a new language however I am very excited to see the different tools that JavaScript has to offer as well as learning them in this environment of constant critical thinking.
