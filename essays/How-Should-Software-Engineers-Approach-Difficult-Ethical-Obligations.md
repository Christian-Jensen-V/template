## Software Engineering Ethics
Ethics in the context of software engineering is a type of professional ethics that is usually practiced by software engineering teams to manage situations. These situations have to be handled in accordance to health, safety, and the welfare of the public. To do this, software engineers must be in compliance with high standards of analysis, specification, design, development, testing, and the maintenance of software. Even for non-professional software engineers, every software engineer is encouraged to adhere to eight principles. Summarized, these eight principles put software engineers in the best interest of the public, the client, and the employer. Their product and modifications must show high levels of refinement, based on professional standards. Managers should have an ethical approach to the management of development. Software engineers and colleagues must be fair and promote ethical practices in their profession and must be supportive of one another. These are important because when designing software, software engineers hold a lot of power and can either choose to do good or bad with this power. The software can do good or inflict harm, or can enable others to do good or inflict harm, or can influence others to do good or inflict harm. To ensure that the software engineerâ€™s efforts are used for good, they strive to keep software engineering a professional, beneficial, and respected profession in accordance with these principles. This, however, is not inclusive of every case that may be present so individual principles should not be used to justify an error, a just of authority, or neglecting to perform an action that one has an obligation to do. There are some if not many situations that software engineers must use their own judgment in compliance with ethics and morality to make difficult decisions. One of these possible situations will be discussed in this technical essay.
