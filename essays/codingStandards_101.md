## Clean Code

With software engineering, software development, and coding in general becoming so popular in this day in age, Coding standards are starting to become not only a good habit to get into, but a sort of necessity to getting hired/working in the field. If you are new to programming, seeing a huge cunk of code (especially HTML code) can be daunting to say the least. Coding standards give a set guidelines similar to MLA format when typing essays. They can make code easy to read and there for less daunting. There exists an argument that learning coding standards, can help one learn a language. With this, I agree and disagree. When I first started to learn how to code, I would easily get lost in a nested loop or complex if/else flow. This is where one aspect of coding standards helped me understand how to read and write code: indenting. Indenting has become such a standard of coding that some languages have changed the syntax to disregard the use of curly braces and instead rely on proper indentation. Indenting, however is not the only aspect of coding standards one must learn to become an expert. In my opinion one of the (more common) coding standards, spaces had somewhat hindered my learning in programming. For example, it is common practice to place a space before any open curly brace. This is something that some IDE's will catch and if you are unaware of the standard - as I was when I first started - you can get easily frustrated by having to "jump through these hoops" of coding standards just to properly run your program. I could run through each aspect of coding standard and give an anecdote of a time I spent an hour trying to edit all my files to fit the coding standard.

## ESLint

I have currently been programming for almost two years now, and am fairly comfortable with the basic format of most coding standards. Sure there are some that differ from others - just like MLA vs. APA - however most agree with ~95% of the same syntax standards. After using ESLint with the Intellij IDE for a little over a week, I can say I really enjoy how easy Intellij makes it to see where you break coding standards and, depending on the issue, even fix it for you with an easy hotkey keystroke. There are times, when I'll write code that I know should be fine but ESLint will make me do it in a slightly different way which can be irritating. ESLint with Intellij will also notify you immediately when you break coding standards, EVEN BEFORE YOU FINISH THE LINE. This was my biggest pet peeve because it's like someone watching me perform a task waiting for me to mess up before I even finish the task. Intellij, however does offer an easy fix to this by giving you the option to delay the big red line after you type something incorrect, therefore giving you time to finish the line before getting the error mark. Overall, it's definately not the worst Linter to use, and I think the standards do help to write "clean" looking code.

## The Old Days

I had one professor tell me about when he first started learning to write code, programming wasn't nearly as popular and how he and his friends would intentionally write ugly code to try to confuse one another and never understand what the other's program actually did. He later told us that while this was fun and challenging, sometimes he would need to go back and edit the code and have no idea what he himself had written. Moral of the story was: write clean code. This is an especially good habit to get into now that we have open-source programming, and more and more collaboration is not only possible but necessary.
