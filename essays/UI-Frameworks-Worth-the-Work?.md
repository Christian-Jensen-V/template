## The original way
Learning HTML and CSS is required for making websites. Someone that designs a website could very much go through their whole career without using anything other than HTML and CSS. But is this effecient? Everything we do is to optimize time, coders shouldn't have to hard code everything when avalible resources are present. In class Underscore proved to be a powerful skill to learn as it could essentially do what three to ten lines of code do in one to two lines. Personally learning things like this for each language speeds up the processes exponentially. However sometimes it can hurt, if a coder is not adept with these resources it takes longer to look up the right function call versus hard coding a couple lines of code. In the case of Semantic UI, it helps coders not stress by improving upon how they code. Instead of getting frustrated with the complexities of raw HTML, Semantic UI has a cool method of classes that use syntax from natural languages.
