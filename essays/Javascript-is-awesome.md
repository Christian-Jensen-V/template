## My favorite language

Java script is a curious language and I think I categorize it as my favorite language so far. It is not lazy per se, but it's the ability to shorthand is amazing. I am a complete newbie but the JS language is not that much different from Java (yet). I think if you want to whip up some fast programs Javascript seems like the language to use. From an engineering perspective, it is less complex than C or C++, which means less possibility for errors. When using C its easy to get choked up in all its complexities because it deals with pointers.

## Solving problems fast

Athletic software engineering with Javascript is awesome because we can think of the problem and try our best to solve the WOD's. It is good that we use Java script because it's ability to assume what you may be trying to do. I like how it tries to interpret strings as numbers if you pass it through a parameter that takes a const. I think that is unique to this language because usually an error will be thrown and your program won't work. The pressure of the WOD's helps students learn how to work fast as they have little time to react. In the workforce, some professions require fast solutions, so building on this skill is very useful. 

## Multiple condition operators

I think this type of structure we learned from code camp is interesting as it allows us to shorten a function significantly. It's good for fast function making, and in difficult WOD's, every second counts.
