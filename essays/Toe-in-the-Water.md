## My First Glimpse at the Abyssal Ocean

My very first encounter with anything programming related was in my Freshman year of Highschool, when the two smartest kids in my class whipped out this 600+ page textbook labeled C/C++. I took one look and decided for myself that I'd never be able to fathom the world of computer science. When I was accepted into college at the University of Hawaii, I declared my major as Mechanical Engineering due to my interest in math/problem solving... as well as my fear of programming. In my very first semester at UH, as an M.E. I was required to take an Electrical Engineering course where, guess what, we're learning the basics of C programming. 

## Big Toe in the Water

In the class, we learned the basics of C programming writing basic console programs with a final project of writing a console "game". A trivial class, but I was hooked. Later, when i figured out that being an M.E. requires zero programming, I switched out of M.E. and into ICS. It is still my belief that if I hadn't taken that class, I would still be in the Engineering department. I can honestly say that every class I have taken towards my new ICS major has been exciting and makes me want to learn more and take on more difficult projects.

## Swimming in the Abyss

After switching majors, I soon find myself itching for more, looking up videos and online courses learning anything I can. Ever since I was little I've loved solving puzzles/problems and playing games. When I write code, I feel like I can see a puzzle in my head, and when I get "stuck" I'll think about it as I go about my day, and suddenly the solution will hit me, and it is the best feeling. I've noticed that I have slowly started to think differently about everyday processes and problems. To this day, when I drive anywhere and come across a stoplight, I can't help but to think of what the code for the intersection looks like and wonder if I could write a more efficient version.

## Conclusion

My introduction and beginning into programming was hardly typical however I'm so glad it happened. In the future I hope to develop all kinds of programs and software. I have a particular interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence and hope to work on projects like the ones at Google's Deepmind. I'm confident my motivation to learn will only grow more as I continue to swim into deeper waters.
